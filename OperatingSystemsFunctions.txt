Memory Management is the most important function of the operating system because it handles or manages primary memory and moves processess
back and forth between main memories and disk during execution. It keeps track of each memory location, regardless it is allocated to
some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processess. It also decides which process will get memory
at what time.
